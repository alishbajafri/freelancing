## **Summary / Roadmap**

2. **Authentication**: `AuthProvider`. Determine role (`freelancer/client`) and render proper profile.
3. **Project & Proposal Management**: `Project`, `Milestone`, `Proposal`, `ProjectContract`. Handle project creation, proposal submission, milestones.
4. **Wallet & Payments**: `WalletProvider`, `Transaction`, `EscrowAccount`, `WithdrawalRequest`. Simulate fund transfer, escrow, auto-replenish.
5. **Messaging & Notifications**: `Conversation`, `Message`. Add chat functionality with attachments and system messages.
6. **Disputes**: `Dispute`, `DisputeResolution`. Add dispute management if client/freelancer reports issues.
7. **User Profiles**: `FreelancerProfile`, `ClientProfile`. Show role-specific dashboards, portfolio, earnings, projects.

**Tip:** Start with **UI + Auth + Project Display** → then **Wallet & Payments** → then **Messaging & Disputes**.
